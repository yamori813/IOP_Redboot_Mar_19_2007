	* src/iop34x_pci.c: Modified the PCI scan to correctly
          assign IO space and setup the Outbound IO Translate value
          correctly.  Also modifed the PCIe scan to work correctly
          with bridge devices.

	* src/iop34x_pci.c: Modified the PCI scan to correctly
          scan the PCIe bus.  A PCIe device will respond to every
          device# for a config read.  Therefore, the IGNORE routine
          was expanded to not allow the PCIe bus to be scanned
          for more than one device number

2005-08-26  Curt Bruns <curt.e.bruns@intel.com>
	* src/iop34x_pci.c: Modifed the PCI routine to only look
	at the TPMI block if the processor is not an 81342.

2005-08-16  Curt Bruns <curt.e.bruns@intel.com>
	* src/iop34x_misc.c: Added function disable_l1_caches()
	to disable DCache and ICache after board has been
	bootstrapped if the semaphore : 
	CYGSEM_HAL_ARM_IQ8134x_DISABLE_L1 is defined.

2005-03-07  Drew Moseley  <drew.moseley@intel.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_xscale_iop34x.cdl: Remove PROCESSOR_CCLK
	configuration points.

2004-11-30  Curt E Bruns  <curt.e.bruns@intel.com>

	* Initial port to the Intel IOP34X I/O Processors
	* Sources ported directly from IOP33X I/O Processor tree
